                  <li>As result of having clearly defined vision and technology plan client was able to roll-out new solution to the remainder of the organization – over 2,000 employees, a total of 800 call center agents , adding WFM, predictive dialing, and QA monitoring- quickly, using internal staff, at significant savings (ROI to client from consultant services estimated at over 600%)</li>
                  <li>Substantially increased customer satisfaction, improved calls/account ratio, and reduced cost of service/account by using improved management information capabilities</li>
